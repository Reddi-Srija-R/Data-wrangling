## Data Wrangling

`Overview`

This repository focuses on data wrangling techniques applied to a Diabetes Prediction Machine Learning project. It is organized into two main parts:

1. CSV Data Processing: Comprehensive handling of data in CSV format, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
2. JSON Data Handling: A Python script for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation from JSON format, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

#### CSV Data Processing

This part of the project handles the CSV data used for diabetes prediction, covering:

a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyzed dataset characteristics.
- Generated summary statistics and visualizations.
- Identified patterns, trends, and outliers.

b. Data Cleaning:

- Managed missing values and outliers.
- Corrected data inconsistencies and removed duplicates.
- Filtered out irrelevant features.

c. Data Transformation:

- Applied normalization and scaling techniques.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Engineered new features for improved model performance.

d. Data Analysis:

- Conducted statistical analyses and hypothesis testing.
- Evaluated the influence of features on diabetes prediction.

#### JSON Data Handling

This part provides a Python script for working with JSON data, featuring:

a. Data Extraction:

- Reads and parses JSON data files.

b. Data Cleaning:

- Cleans JSON data using custom methods.

c. Data Transformation:

- Converts data into a format suitable for further analysis or model training.

d. OOP Concepts:

- Uses classes and objects to manage data processing tasks.

e. Logging and Exception Handling:

- Implements logging for execution tracking and debugging.
- Includes exception handling to address potential errors.
